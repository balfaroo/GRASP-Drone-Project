Hello! This is the repository for the GRASP Drone project, a senior project from Princeton University that sought to develop a drone that can autonomously retrieve and dropoff objects. Here you can find the CAD files and code for the drone, which is all documented on the "Build guide.docx" file. Please read through that file, as it should summarize most of the components and steps you'll need to take to build off of the project.
